*welcome in :)*

My name is Victoria but you can call me Tor. My main goal is to point out the smallest details you would never care for otherwise. In the newest update i bring attention to the little collection of dead flies on your windowsill. They will not move, only grow in number.


Prepare for irregular updates which tweak the program just enough to recognise a small change. Over time, my focus will shift onto different and more uncomfortable objects. 

**Works best from 11pm to 4am, a few bugs occur otherwise.**
